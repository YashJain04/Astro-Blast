# Astro Blast 🚀☄️
Our submission for CSI 4130 Project - Assignment 4 is Astro Blast! We created a game leveraging several [technologies](#technologies--libraries-leveraged-️).

# Game Details 🛠️⚙️
Astro Blast is a space shooter video game! 🛸

The user is required to [navigate](#game-controls-️) the spaceship and destroy in-coming asteroids. The spaceship can shoot bullets and blast rockets, and on impact with asteroids you can see animations such as explosions 💥 and physics. The game also includes several abilities such as a shield, allowing the user to solidify their health bar and negate/avoid all damage from asteroids the spaceship collides with. It also includes a regeneration ability allowing the user to reset their health back to max - 100%. The spaceship is created from models (made in blender and more) and includes an abundance of effects (fire, smoke, etc.). Astro Blast also includes several key features in the background such as planets, star fields, meteor showers, streaking comets with tails, and even nebula, thus allowing an immersive and realistic space experience. The game ends upon defeat (A.K.A when the spaceship has 0 health) and you can see an explosion upon the game ending indicating the spaceship has broken and been eliminated. It is then reset and restarted automatically, so the user can play again! 🙌
